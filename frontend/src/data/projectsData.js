        description: `
            <p>This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the classic Snake game using <strong>Stable-Baselines3</strong>. Key aspects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Custom Snake environment built with <code>Gymnasium</code>, featuring both image-based observations and additional vector features.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Training with <strong>PPO</strong> and <strong>DQN</strong>, with PPO showing the best performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Training:</strong> Curriculum learning strategy with dynamic apple count, TensorBoard monitoring, and evaluation callbacks. The best model reached an average of ~3000 steps per episode and 278 mean reward.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Live rendering with Pygame and training progress tracked via TensorBoard charts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The agent demonstrates efficient apple collection but still struggles with self-trapping, which is a target for future improvements.</p>
