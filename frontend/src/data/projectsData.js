            <p>An application that automatically summarizes videos from URL into structured <strong>Markdown</strong> notes. Built with modular architecture, the project explores both open-source and commercial LLMs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transcription:</strong> Extracting audio with <code>yt-dlp</code> and transcribing using <strong>OpenAI Whisper</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Generating structured summaries with <strong>GPT-4o-mini</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Prototypes:</strong> Two versions tested:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Colab notebook: <strong>LLaMA 3.1 (quantized)</strong> + Whisper</li>
                        <li>Jupyter notebook: <strong>OpenAI Whisper + GPT</strong> with Gradio UI</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>API:</strong> Final version designed as a <strong>FastAPI</strong> service for easy integration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project demonstrates practical use of speech-to-text pipelines, LLM summarization, and lightweight user interfaces with <strong>Gradio</strong>.</p>

        description: `
            <p>This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the classic Snake game using <strong>Stable-Baselines3</strong>. Key aspects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Custom Snake environment built with <code>Gymnasium</code>, featuring both image-based observations and additional vector features.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Training with <strong>PPO</strong> and <strong>DQN</strong>, with PPO showing the best performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Training:</strong> Curriculum learning strategy with dynamic apple count, TensorBoard monitoring, and evaluation callbacks. The best model reached an average of ~3000 steps per episode and 278 mean reward.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Live rendering with Pygame and training progress tracked via TensorBoard charts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The agent demonstrates efficient apple collection but still struggles with self-trapping, which is a target for future improvements.</p>
