        description:
            `
            <p>The project serves as a practical demonstration of linear regression and the gradient descent algorithm with an implementation in Python. The goal is to understand fundamental machine learning techniques, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Analysis of its functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Gradient Descent:</strong> Application of the optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function during model training.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Process Visualization:</strong> Graphical representation of model weight updates.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project provides practical insight into these techniques through the implementation and analysis of the linear regression model training process.</p>
