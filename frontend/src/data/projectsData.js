            <p>A RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that helps developers quickly find answers in technical documentation for <strong>PyTorch</strong> and <strong>FastAPI</strong>. Key aspects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Pipeline:</strong> Automated ingestion of documentation from GitHub repositories, parsing Markdown/RST files, and intelligent chunking by sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Vector Search:</strong> Document embeddings generated with <strong>OpenAI text-embedding-3-large</strong>, stored in <strong>ChromaDB</strong> for fast semantic retrieval.</li>
                <li><strong>LLM Integration:</strong> Answers generated by <strong>GPT-4o-mini</strong> with context from retrieved documentation chunks and source citations.</li>
                <li><strong>API:</strong> Production-ready <strong>FastAPI</strong> backend with health checks, example questions endpoint, and comprehensive Pydantic validation.</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Containerized with <strong>Docker</strong> and deployed on <strong>GCP Cloud Run</strong> with CI/CD via GitHub Actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project demonstrates practical implementation of RAG architecture, from data ingestion to production deployment, solving a real developer pain point.</p>
